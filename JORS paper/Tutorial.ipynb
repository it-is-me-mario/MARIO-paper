    "In this example, we show a simple yet comprehensive tutorial on the main features of the MARIO modelling framework.\n",
    "This example requires the user to first download the Exiobase hybrid supply-use table referred to year 2011 from this link: https://zenodo.org/record/7244919#.ZGOGbk_P23A\n",
    "\n",
    "The downloaded folder can be stored in any directory. The path to this folder is indicated henceforth with \"exio_path\".\n",

    "To start parsing the downloaded table, it is necessary to have MARIO installed (link to the installation guide here: https://mario-suite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), to import it and to call the saved MARIO Database object called \"world\" by using the hybrid_sut_exiobase function. Also, it is possible to filter over the desired environmental extensions. Any of the sheets stored in the \"MR_HSUTs_2011_v3_3_18_extensions.xlsx\" files can be provided, as a list. In this case we are going to use only the \"Emiss\" extensions, referring to the emissions transactions.    "
